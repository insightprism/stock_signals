# **Project Spec: Platinum "Squeeze" & Sentiment Engine (P.S.S.E.)**\n\n## **1. Purpose & Core Objective**\n**Purpose:** To automate the extraction and synthesis of multi-dimensional market data to predict "Short Squeeze" events and "Value Rotations" in the platinum market.\n**Objective:** The program must monitor three distinct layers of data (Paper, Physical, and Retail) to generate a single "Consolidated Sentiment Score" and trigger automated buy/sell alerts.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Design Architecture**\nThe system should follow a **Modular Adapter Pattern** so that data sources can be updated without breaking the core logic:\n\n1.  **Data Adapters:** Independent scripts to pull from:\n    * **CFTC (COT Reports):** Managed Money net positions.\n    * **Metals APIs:** Spot prices for Gold and Platinum.\n    * **Exchange Scrapers:** Lease rates (London) and Inventory (NYMEX).\n    * **Social/Search Scrapers:** Google Trends and Social Media mention frequency.\n2.  **Synthesis Engine:** Processes raw data into normalized metrics (0.0 to 1.0).\n3.  **Alert Layer:** Sends notification (Slack/Email/Terminal) when the "Squeeze Probability" exceeds a threshold.\n\n---\n\n## **3. The Sentiment Drivers (The "Logic")**\nThe program should calculate the following drivers to predict price movements:\n\n### **A. Paper Fragility (COT Data)**\n* **Metric:** Managed Money Short Exposure.\n* **Logic:** If **Short Interest** > 1.0M shares AND **Price** is stable/rising, the "Coil" is tightening. \n* **Predictor:** A spike in "Fails to Deliver" (FTD) alongside high short interest indicates a 10%+ vertical move is imminent.\n\n### **B. Physical Scarcity (Lease Rates & Basis)**\n* **Metric:** Spot-to-Futures Spread (Backwardation).\n* **Logic:** If `Spot Price > 3-Month Future`, the market is in "Acute Shortage."\n* **Predictor:** Historically, persistent backwardation + rising lease rates (>5%) leads to a 2-week "Price Spike" as industrial users panic-buy.\n\n### **C. Retail Rotation (Status Arbitrage)**\n* **Metric:** Gold-to-Platinum (G/P) Ratio.\n* **Logic:** Target Mean Reversion. Current Ratio (~2.2) vs. Fundamental Target (1.5).\n* **Predictor:** Every 0.05 drop in the G/P ratio indicates "Capital Migration." When search volume for "Buy Platinum" spikes by 200% YoY, the "Meme Status" multiplier is applied.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Prompt for Claude Code / LLM Builder**\n\n> "Act as a Senior Fintech Engineer. Build a Python-based **Platinum Sentiment Engine** that extracts market data from the following sources:\n> \n> 1. **Price Data:** Use a free API (like Metals-API or Yahoo Finance) to get the daily Gold/Platinum ratio. \n> 2. **COT Data:** Access the CFTC.gov 'Legacy' or 'Disaggregated' reports for Platinum (PL) to track 'Managed Money' short/long positions.\n> 3. **Inventory:** Scrape or API-fetch NYMEX Platinum warehouse stocks (Registered vs. Eligible).\n> \n> **Calculation Logic:**\n> Create a function `calculate_squeeze_score()` that returns a value from 0-100 based on:\n> - **40% Weight:** Net short position of Hedge Funds (Higher shorts = higher score).\n> - **30% Weight:** Backwardation status (If Spot > Futures, add 30 points).\n> - **30% Weight:** Gold/Platinum Ratio (If Ratio > 2.0, add points for 'Value Gap').\n> \n> **Output Requirements:**\n> - A CLI dashboard showing current Price, Ratio, Short Interest, and Squeeze Score.\n> - A 'V-Recovery' alert if the price dropped >10% on a Friday but Short Interest remained stable (The 'Monday Bounce' signal).\n> - Use standard libraries: `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`. Ensure the code is modular and includes a `config.py` for API keys."\n\n---\n\n## **5. How to use this program for Prediction**\nOnce built, you should run the program every **Friday at 4:00 PM EST** (when the new COT report is released):\n1.  **Check the "Hedge Fund Net":** If they added shorts while the price held steady during the week, you are in the "Launch Phase."\n2.  **Check the Ratio:** If the Ratio is 2.2 and starts dropping toward 2.1, your "Rotation" is happening.\n3.  **The Trigger:** If the **Squeeze Score** is >75, it is a high-conviction "Buy" signal for a 72-hour breakout.
