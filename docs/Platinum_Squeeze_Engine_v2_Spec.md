# **Project Spec: Platinum Sentiment & Squeeze Engine (P.S.S.E.) v2.0**\n\n## **1. Purpose & Objective**\nTo automate the prediction of platinum price breakouts by synthesizing technical market mechanics with a **Synthetic Daily Sentiment Index (DSI)**.\n\n## **2. Design Architecture**\nThe system uses a **Triangulation Model**:\n1. **Paper Market Adapter:** Tracks Managed Money (Hedge Fund) short interest via CFTC/COT.\n2. **Physical Market Adapter:** Tracks Lease Rates and Spot-to-Futures spreads (Backwardation).\n3. **Synthetic DSI Adapter (Crowd Sentiment):** A module that scrapes social media (X, Reddit) to replicate a 'Daily Sentiment Index' without a manual survey.\n\n## **3. The 'Synthetic DSI' Module (New Logic)**\nThis module mimics the contrarian indicator from 'trade-futures.com' by analyzing real-time crowd behavior.\n* **Data Sources:** StockTwits ($PL), Reddit (r/WallStreetBets keywords), and X (#PlatinumSqueeze).\n* **Analysis Engine:** Uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to score posts from -1 (Max Panic) to +1 (Max FOMO).\n* **DSI Conversion:** Scales the average sentiment score into a 0-100 index.\n* **Logic:** \n    - **DSI < 15:** 'Blood in the streets.' High probability of a floor (Contrarian Buy Signal).\n    - **DSI > 85:** 'Extreme Greed.' High probability of a retail blow-off top (Caution Signal).\n\n## **4. Squeeze Prediction Logic**\nThe 'Squeeze Score' (0-100) is calculated as follows:\n* **Paper Weight (35%):** Managed Money Short Position density.\n* **Physical Weight (30%):** Spot price premium over futures (Backwardation).\n* **Contrarian DSI Weight (35%):** Divergence between DSI and Short Interest. \n    - *High Squeeze Probability:* Managed Money is heavily **SHORT** while DSI is **LOW** (Crowd has given up, and shorts are over-leveraged).\n\n## **5. Prompt for Claude Code / LLM Builder**\n\n> "Act as a Senior Quant Engineer. Build a Python program that integrates the following:\n> 1. **Data Pulls:** Metals-API for spot prices, CFTC.gov for COT Short/Long positions for Platinum (PL).\n> 2. **Synthetic DSI:** Scrape 'StockTwits' or use the 'ntscraper' library for X. Apply VADER Sentiment Analysis to compute a 0-100 index for #Platinum.\n> 3. **The Squeeze Score:** Logic must find 'Divergences.' If Hedge Funds are net-short by >1.0M shares but the Synthetic DSI is under 20 (Max Fear), output a 'STRONG BUY: POTENTIAL SQUEEZE' alert.\n> 4. **Dashboard:** Display: [Spot Price] [G/P Ratio] [Managed Money Short %] [Digital DSI Score]."\n\n## **6. Operational Playbook**\n* **Run Frequency:** Daily at Market Open (for DSI) and Fridays at 4:00 PM EST (for COT).\n* **The 'Friday Massacre' Bounce:** If Friday price drops > 10% and DSI hits < 15, trigger a 'Monday Recovery' alert if Short Interest remained steady."
